How to Protect a Smart Identity Card
While enjoying the benefits of its advanced technology, holders of a Smart Identity Card should remember that the smart identity card is an important identification document. Although the card is made of a very durable and secure base material, the holder needs to protect it properly against damage. The following guidelines will help in keeping the card in good condition at all times:
Keep the card in an appropriate protective holder
Do not bend the card or test it with a magnet
Do not place the card together with keys or coins
Avoid scratching the chip when using the e-Cert in the card
Do not try to remove the chip from the card
Obligations
Smart identity card holders are obliged to keep their cards in proper condition and carry them at all times. If the card is lost, destroyed, damaged or defaced, the holder must apply for a new card at a Registration of Persons Office within 14 days, or within 14 days of his/her return if he/she is outside Hong Kong. Recovered cards must be surrendered to a Registration of Persons Office or police station.
Personal Data Protection
Personal data on the smart identity card are fully protected by the following measures:
The collection, storage, use and release of data are governed by the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Registration of Persons Ordinance and Registration of Persons Regulations.
Only authorised departments have access to the relevant database, and there is no sharing of databases among government departments.
Privacy Impact Assessments are conducted periodically.
Holders can view the data on their cards through smart identity card readers installed at immigration self-service kiosks after their identities have been authenticated.
Only minimal data are stored in the chip. More sensitive data are kept in back-end computer systems. All non-immigration applications of the smart identity card are voluntary options.
Data for different applications are segregated. The chip is designed with segregated compartments to separate immigration applications from other value-added non-immigration functions.
